The Chrome browsers Dino game player using a LDR sensor and servo with ATmega4809 microcontroller.

## Technology
This project is created with:
* MPLABX version: 5.45
* ATmega4809 microcontroller
* Breadboard kit with LDR and servo

## Setup
To run this code, install it locally to your computer.
Setup the breadboard like in the pictures below.
The LDR goes as close to the monitor as possible and with a small gap to the dino.
The servo goes above the space button.
